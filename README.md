## DevOps best practices

### Branch protection

Enable branch protection on the main branch of the repository to prevent unreviewed branch merges from affecting the working state of main.
To do this in Github you can add branch protection to add requirements to be met before any merges take place. In my example I require a pull request to be reviewed and approved before merges.
